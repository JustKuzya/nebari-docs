# Choosing a deployment platform

Nebari can be deployed on a bare-metal server using HPC, as well as on the major public cloud provider, or on a pre-existing Kubernetes cluster. Review the options below to determine which option best suits your needs.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud" default>

The cloud deployment of Nebari is considered to be the default option. It enables teams to build and maintain a cost-effective and scalable compute/data science platform in the cloud, by using an [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) approach that streamlines the deployment and management of data science infrastructure.

If you are not sure which option to choose, a cloud installation is likely your best option. It is suitable for most use cases, especially if:

- You require scalable infrastructure

- You aim to have a production environment with GitOps enabled by default

- Your team does not have specific expertise within high-performance computing hardware, Kubernetes, Docker, and/or other cloud-native or scalable compute infrastructure technologies

:::note
The cloud installation is based on Kubernetes, but knowledge of Kubernetes is **NOT** required nor is in-depth knowledge about the specific provider required either.

Currently, Nebari supports [Amazon AWS](/how-tos/nebari-aws.md), [DigitalOcean](/how-tos/nebari-do.md), [Google GCP](/how-tos/nebari-gcp.md), and [Azure](/how-tos/nebari-azure.md).

Below you will find more details about the supported cloud providers and their respective instructions on initializing and deploying Nebari.

# Choosing cloud providers

Now that Nebari is successfully installed, we can move forward with choosing the most suitable cloud provider to help you effectively deploy and start your projects within Nebari.

To deploy Nebari, each cloud provider requires fairly wide permissions to create all the necessary cloud resources, which are governed by the **`access keys`** generated by the provider. Once you have chosen your preferred cloud provider, follow the steps described in their respective How-to Guides(how-tos/overview) to stand up a Nebari deployment on their platform.

[Google GCP](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/installation/setup.html#google-cloud-platform) (also known as Google Cloud Platform or GCP) is a provider of computing resources for developing, deploying, and operating computing services.

<TabItem value="do" label="Digital Ocean">

</div>

[DigitalOcean](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/installation/setup.html#digital-ocean) is a cloud hosting provider that offers cloud computing services and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) known for its pricing and scalability.

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/installation/setup.html#amazon-web-services-aws) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

:::warning
While all of the above cloud providers offer free-tier accounts, some of Nebari's infrastructure resources may lie outside the scope of the free-tier quotas of these accounts, and Nebari will not prompt you when these limits are exceeded. Therefore, if your intention is to try out Nebari by carrying out a quick trial installation, you should start with a [local Nebari installation](/tutorials/nebari-local-development) to be sure to avoid any unexpected charges.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="hpc" label="HPC">

Nebari HPC is an opinionated open source deployment of JupyterHub based on an HPC jobscheduler (e.g. Slurm). Nebari HPC is a "distribution" of these packages much like Debian and Ubuntu are distributions of Linux.

:::note
To note, Nebari HPC can be used on other distributed compute hardware, not just HPC hardware specifically. We anticipate that Nebari HPC will be used most often on HPC hardware, however.
:::

The high level goal of this distribution is to form a cohesive set of tools that enable:

- Environment management via [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and [`conda-store`](https://conda-store.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Monitoring of compute infrastructure and services

- Scalable and efficient compute via Jupyterlab and Dask

- On-prem deployment of Jupyterhub without requiring deep DevOps knowledge of the Slurm/HPC and Jupyter ecosystems

Nebari HPC should be your choice if:

- You have highly optimized code that requires highly performant infrastructure

- You have existing HPC infrastructure

- You expect that your projects will not exceed the resources/capabilities of your current infrastructure

For instructions on installing and deploying Nebari HPC, visit the [How to install and setup Nebari HPC on bare metal machines](/how-tos/nebari-hpc) section of the documentation.

:::note
Although it is possible to deploy Nebari HPC in the cloud, it is not generally recommended due to potentially high costs. For more information, check out the [base cost] section of the docs.

<TabItem value="local" label="Pre-existing Kubernetes cluster">

The pre-existing (or local) version is recommended for **testing and development** of Nebariâ€™s components due to its simplicity. Choose the local mode if:

- You already have a Kubernetes cluster on one of the Nebari's supported cloud providers
- You want to test your Kubernetes cluster
- You have available local compute setup
- You want to try out Nebari with a quick install for exploratory purposes, without setting up environment variables

You should choose another installation option, likely a **cloud install** if you are starting from scratch (you have no compute clusters already in place) and you desire to stand up a production instance of Nebari.

For instructions on installing and deploying Nebari on an existing infrastructure, please visit [How to install and setup Nebari on an existing Kubernetes infrastructure](/how-tos/nebari-kubernetes).
