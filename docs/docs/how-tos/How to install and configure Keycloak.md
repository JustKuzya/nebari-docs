## Configuring Keycloak

[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is the name of the open-source user management software that's automatically deployed within Nebari. It's used to store the database of all
users in your Nebari instance, and can provide connectivity to other services such as GitHub/Auth0 single sign-on.

As with many user admin tools, in Keycloak you start with an initial login (`root`) that has the ability to administer and create new users. The `root` user is a Keycloak-specific user. It can only be used to login and manage the Keycloak identity management section of Nebari. It's not a user of the wider Nebari data science platform.

## Change Keycloak root password

`root`'s password is generated by the `nebari init` command. If you ran this command while following the steps under [Installing Nebari](/getting-started/installing-nebari), you should have seen something like the following in your terminal output:

```
Securely generated default random password=<alphanumeric-string> for Keycloak root user
```

The init command also saves the root user password to your `nebari-config.yaml` configuration file under the following path:

`security.keycloak.initial_root_password`

After the initial deployment, it is **highly** recommended that you change the Keycloak `root` user password as soon as you can.

:::note
Once you change the root password you will not be able to [add users from the command line](#add-user-from-the-command-line)
:::

:::note
From this point on, the `security.keycloak.initial_root_password` field in `nebari-config.yaml` has no effect. If you redeploy Nebari it will not reset the password back to the old one (or anything else that might be in the field in your YAML file). We strongly recommend you delete this field to prevent later confusion.
:::

1. To change the `root` user password, go to your Nebari instance's admin dashboard - e.g., something like <https://mydomain.com/auth/admin/> â€” and log in with the password provided.

2. From there, click on the **Root** dropdown in the top right of the screen, and select **Manage account**.

3. Under **Account Security** click **Signing In**.

    ![Keycloak root user page - account security](/img/how-tos/keycloak_root_user_account_security.png)

4. In the Password section, click the **Update** button. This will guide you through entering your existing root password, and then creating a new password.

## Adding a Nebari user

You will need to add a Nebari user in order to log in to your Nebari platform. If you have chosen to use GitHub or Auth0 single-sign-on, you must ensure the value you enter in Keycloak under ``Username`` exactly matches the usernames from GitHub or Auth0, respectively.

### Add user using Keycloak console

To add a Nebari user from the web console for Keycloak, visit <https://mydomain.com/auth/admin/>. Log in using the username `root`, as shown above.

All Nebari users will be part of the `nebari` realm (a realm is a distinct identity provider and set of users in Keycloak).

:::note
The root user alone is a member of the `master` realm.
:::

The `nebari` realm is selected by default, we strongly recommend leaving it as is.

Steps to create a new user:

1. Click **Users** along the left-hand side of the page.

2. Click the **Add user** button and you will see the new user form:

    ![Keycloak add user tab screenshot - new user form](/img/how-tos/keycloak_add_users.png)

3. Fill out the three fields outlined above. These are **Username**, **Email**, and **Groups**. (We explain these fields below.) Then click **save**.

   - Username: Depending on the authentication provider selected ('password', 'GitHub' or 'Auth0'), the values entered into the **Username** field will differ slightly. The following table outlines
those differences:

  |          | Password          | GitHub            | Auth0                 |
  | -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
  | Username | *unique username* | *GitHub username* | *Email to login with* |

   - Once the **Username** field is updated, please add a valid email address in the **Email** field.

    :::note
    Although not required, users may not be able to log in to Grafana if this field isn't properly set.
    :::

   - Associate the user with one or more of the **Groups**. Out of the box, Nebari is deployed with the following groups: ``admin``, ``analyst``, and ``developer`` (see the [Roles x Groups](#roles-x-groups) section below for more details).

4. Click **Save**.


If you are using the password authentication provider, you will also need to define a password for the user. Keep in mind that, if using Auth0 or Github the password field is not required. It's best to put the **Temporary** toggle in the **OFF** position. Otherwise the user will be forced to change the password on first login.

### Add user from the command line

To make adding users easier for new Nebari deployments, the follwoing client command will help you with this.

```shell
nebari keycloak -c nebari-config.yaml adduser <username> <password>
```

This will create a new user `<username>` under the ``analyst`` group, with the initial password provided. Omit the password completely if you are using GitHub or Auth0.

:::note
If you [changed the initial root password for Keycloak](#change-keycloak-root-password) this method will not work.

## Login to Nebari

Your new user can now log in to Nebari, visit your provided Nebari domain URI which will take you to the login form page and follow the [How to login in to Nebari and start a server](/how-tos/login-keycloak).

## Roles x Groups

Groups represent a collection of users that perform similar actions and therefore require similar permissions. By default, Nebari is deployed with the following groups: ``admin``,
``developer``, ``analyst`` and ``viewer`` (in roughly descending order of power).

| Group       | Access to Nebari Resources                                                                    | Roles | Permissions Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| ``admin``     | <ul><li>Conda-Store</li><li>Dask</li><li>Jupyterhub</li><li>Grafana</li></ul> |   <ul><li>``conda_store_admin``</li><li>``dask_admin``</li><li>``jupyterhub_admin``</li><li>``grafana_admin``</li></ul> | Blank |
| ``developer`` | <ul><li>Conda-Store</li><li>Dask</li><li>Jupyterhub</li><li>Grafana Developer</li></ul> | <ul><li>``conda_store_developer``</li><li>``dask_developer``</li><li>``jupyterhub_developer``</li><li>``grafana_developer``</li></ul> | Blank |
| ``analyst``   | <ul><li>Conda-Store</li><li>Jupyterhub</li><li>Grafana</li></ul>  | <ul><li>``conda_store_developer``</li><li>``jupyterhub_developer``</li><li>``grafana_viewer``</li></ul> | Blank |

To create new groups or modify (or delete) existing groups, log in as `root` and click **Groups** on the left-hand side.

As an example, we create a new group named `conda-store-manager`. This group will have administrator access to the [Conda-Store service].

1. Click **New** in the upper-right hand corner under **Groups**.

  ![Keycloak groups tab screenshot - user groups view](/img/how-tos/keycloak_groups.png)

   - Then, give the new group an appropriate name.

  ![Keycloak add group form - name field set to conda-store-manager](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group1.png)

2. Under **Role Mapping**, add the appropriate **Client Roles** as needed; there should be no need to update the **Realm Roles**.

  ![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused with expanded client roles dropdown](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group2.png)

In this example, the new group only has one mapped role (`conda_store_admin`); however it's possible to attached multiple **Client Roles** to a single group.

  ![Keycloak group conda-store-manager form - role mappings tab focused ](/img/how-tos/keycloak_new_group3.png)

Once complete, return to the **Users** section in the dashboard and add the relevant users to this newly created group.
