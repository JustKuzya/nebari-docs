title: How to set Nebari's DNS Domain Registry
---

# Nebari domain registry setup

This domain will be where your application will be exposed.

Currently, Nebari only supports CloudFlare for automatic DNS registration. If an alternate DNS provider is desired, change the `--dns-provider` flag from **cloudflare** to **none** on the Nebari deploy command. The deployment process will then pause when it asks for an IP address (or CNAME, if using AWS) and prompt you to provide the desired URL.

Setting a DNS record heavily depends on the provider, and thus itâ€™s not possible to provide detailed docs here on how to create a record on all the providers out there. Searching "setting a DNS reccord" or "setting a CNAME DNS reccord" on your specific provider should yield good results.
