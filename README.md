🏗 An opinionated open source JupyterHub distribution

## Documentation

### Building the site

Install the neccesary packages
```bash
cd docs
npm installl
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at <http://localhost:3000/>.
